summary:    VC5 DRM

This week was fairly focused on getting my BCM7268 board up and
running and building the kernel module for it.  I first got the board
booting to an NFS root on an upstream kernel -- huge thanks to the STB
team for the upstreaming work they've done, so that I could just TFTP
load an upstream kernel and start working.

The second half of the week was building the DRM module.  I started
with copying from vc4, since our execution model is very similar.  We
have an MMU now, so I replaced the CMA helpers with normal shmem file
allocation, and started building bits we'll need to have a page table
per DRM file descriptor.  I also ripped out the display components --
we're 3D only now, and any display hardware would be in a separate
kernel module and communicate through dma-bufs.  Finally, I put
together a register header, debugfs register decode, and part of the
interrupt handlers.  Next week it's going to be getting our first
interrupts handled and filling out the MMU, then I should be on to
trying to actually paint some pixels!
