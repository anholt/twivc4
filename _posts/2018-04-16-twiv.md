summary:    VC4 display, VC5 kernel
categories:

On the vc4 front, I did the investigation of the HDL to determine that
the OLED matrix applies before the gamma tables, so we can expose it
in the DRM for Android's color correction.  Stefan was also interested
in reworking his fencing patches to use syncobjs, so hopefully we can
merge those and get DRM HWC support in mainline soon.

I also took a look at a warning we're seeing when a cursor with a
nonzero hotspot goes to the upper left corner of the screen --
unfortunately, fixing it properly looks like it'll be a bit of a
rework.

I finally took a moment to port over an etnaviv change to remove the
need for a DRM subsystem node in the DT.  This was a request from Rob
Herring long ago, but etnaviv's change finally made it clear what we
should be doing instead.

For vc5, I stabilized the GPU scheduler work and pushed it to my main
branch.  I've now started working on using the GMP to isolate clients
from each other (important for being able to have unprivileged GPU
workloads running alongside X, and also for making sure that say, some
misbehaving webgl doesn't trash your X server's other window
contents).  Hopefully once this security issue is resolved, I can
(finally!) propose merging it to the kernel.
