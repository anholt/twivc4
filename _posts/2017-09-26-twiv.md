Last week I was at the X Developers Conference, where I gave a talk
about the vc4 and vc5 projects
([video](https://youtu.be/F3uRpOI0xi0?list=PLt6hUXQez2dcnyMdOp8E7cJCBSTZ6KMby&t=6447)).

Probably the best result of that talk was a developer mentioning to me
that the AMDGPU kernel driver's execbuf model resolved my concerns
about the VC5 submit ioctl I was building: All private buffers are
implicitly included in an exec, the kernel tracks a list of evicted
buffers to be brought back in (probably empty), and it uses a single
reservation object for all the non-shared buffers in the address
space, so that there are no O(n) walks in the kernel!

As far as code goes, I'm continuing to make progress on the VC5 Vulkan
port.  This so far involves copying code from the Intel ("anv") driver
trying to get the symbols all implemented, and replacing the core
structures I think I need to (batchbuffers and relocation lists turned
into a set of command lists and buffers referenced, but without
relocations).  I've also picked a few bits out of the AMD ("radv")
driver, where they've done things I need that Intel didn't have.

Next up in userspace is to get the VC5 code merged (I'm still blocked
on review of the NIR alphatest pass, and the patch where I touch
common build system stuff to hook the vc5 driver into it), get bcmv to
the point where it links (buffer layout is the next big chunk of code
to write), finish off state emission, and then start trying to get my
first Vulkan triangle rendered.
