For V3D last week, I resurrected my old GLES 3.1 series with SSBO and
shader imgae support, rebuilt it for V3D 4.1 (shader images no longer
need manual tiling), and wrote indirect draw support and started on
compute shaders.  As of this weekend, dEQP-GLES31 is passing 1387/1567
of tests with "compute" in the name on the simulator.  I have a fix
needed for barrier(), then it's time to build the kernel interface.
In the process, I ended up fixing several job flushing bugs, plugging
memory leaks, improving our shader disassembly debug dumps, and
reducing memory consumption and CPU overhead.

The TFU series is now completely merged, and the kernel cache
management series from last week is now also merged.  I also fixed a
bug in the core GPU scheduler that would cause use-after-frees when
tracing.

For vc4, Boris completed and merged the H/V flipping work after fixing
display of flipped/offset SAND images.  More progress has been made on
chamelium testing, so we're nearing having automated regression tests
for parts of our display stack.  My PM driver has the acks we needed,
but my co-maintainer has tacked a new request on in v3 so it'll be
delayed.
