- Fixed non-2D texturing
- Fixed GPU hang with no vertex elements used
- Fixed many subtests of fbo-clear-formats
- Fixed many subtests of fbo-blending-formats
- Fixed glGetTexImage() after FBO rendering to RGB10_A2 textures
- Fixed enabling of stencil tests
- Fixed fneg(0.0) not producing -0.0
- Fixed unpack_*_4x8 shader opcodes
- Fixed filtering of GL_CLAMP (desktop GL compatibility) texture wrap mode
- Fixed gl_FragCoord pixel center behavior
