summary:    Raspberry Pi 4, moving on
categories: 
---

Recently the Raspberry Pi Foundation released the Raspberry Pi 4,
which shipped with the V3D driver I wrote as its GLES driver.

I'm pretty proud of the work I did on the project.  I was a solo
developer building a GLES3 graphics driver based on Mesa, splitting my
time between the new V3D and maintaining VC4, while also fixing issues
in the X server and building a kernel driver.  I didn't finish
everything (the hardware should be able to do GLES 3.2, and I almost
made it to CTS-complete on 3.1 before shipping), but I feel like this
is clear proof of how productive graphics driver developers can be
working on the Mesa stack.

Now, I'm working at Google on the freedreno graphics driver and Mesa
in general, as part of the Chrome OS graphics team.  The folks at
Igalia are taking over from me on V3D (I've already done a bunch of
review of perf improvement and bugfix patches they've made), and
Bootlin is going to be continuing to work on getting open source
display to parity with the closed source stack.  The future of open
source Raspberry Pi graphics is still looking good, even if I'm not
driving it any more.
