summary:    VC5 GL, VC4 stability, VC4 backport
categories: 
---

Another series of VC5 GL features this week:

- Mostly implemented Z32F_S8 texture/FBO support (building new helpers
  for other drivers that have to do this)
- Implemented helpers in core gallium for mappings of MSAA buffers.
- Landed fix for stencil reference values.
- Landed fix for colormasks for BGRA (not RGBA) FBOs.
- Landed fix for clear color for BGRA FBOs.
- Landed fix for 16/32-bit integer texturing.

For VC4, I reviewed and landed a bugfix that would cause kernel oopses
in the IRQ handler path for the out-of-memory signal.  I think this
covered the only known oops in VC4's 3D.

I also spent a while on the VC4 backport, debugging a regression
related to the DSI changes: Now when the panel is disconnected, the
VC4 driver won't load when the DSI panel is present in the overlay.
Unfortunately, there aren't really good solutions for this because in
the ARM DT world, the assumption is that your hardware is fixed and
you can't just optionally plug hardware in without doing a bunch of
manual editing of your DT.  I'm working with the DRM bridge
maintainers to come up with a plan.
