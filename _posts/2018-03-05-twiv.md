This week I got the new hardware-accelerated blits for YUV import to
GL working again.

The pipeline I have is
[drm_mmal](https://github.com/anholt/drm_mmal/tree/x11) decoding 360
frames of 1080p Big Buck Bunny trailer using MMAL, importing them to
GL as an image_external texture, drawing to the back buffer, and
pageflipping.

Switching MMAL from producing linear RGBA buffers to linear NV12
buffers improved FPS by 18.4907% +/- 0.746806% (n=7), and to YV12 by
14.4922% +/- 0.569289%.  The improvement is slightly understated, as
there's some fixed overhead of waiting for vcsm to time out to
indicate that the stream is complete.

I also polished up Dave's SAND support patch for KMS, and submitted
it.  This lets video decode into KMS planes skip a copy of the buffers
(I didn't do performance comparisons of this, though).

[Patches](https://github.com/anholt/mesa/commits/vc4-yuv-tex) are
submitted, and the next step will be to implement import of SAND
buffers in GL to match the KMS support.
