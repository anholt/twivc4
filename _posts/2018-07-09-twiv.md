summary:    V3D conformance, VC4 writeback
categories: 
---

Now that my V3D GPU hangs are cleared up, I made a lot of progress on
conformance:

Fixes from last week:

* Don't reset the GPU until it stops making progress on the job (instead of just a fixed timeout).
* Fixed noperspective interpolation
* Fixed leaks of default attributes and spill BOs.
* Fixed ARB_color_buffer_float clamping of gl_FragData[]
* Fixed support for GL_EXT_draw_buffers2's independent blend enables.
* Fixed GL_SAMPLE_ALPHA_TO_ONE.

Fail/(Pass+Fail) ratios after my weekend run:

* EGL: 96/2143
* GLES2: 7/16985
* GLES3: 25/42549
* GLES3 multisample: crash!

I've debugged the first MSAA crash, but there are some MSAA resolve
bugs after that which I need to sort out (some of which are probably
the cause of those EGL failures).

On the VC4 front, Boris landed the writeback changes, and I submitted
the DT for it in my ARM pull request.
