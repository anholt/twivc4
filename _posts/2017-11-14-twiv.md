summary:    VC5 GL, VC4 MADVISE, VC4 backports
categories: 
---

Another series of VC5 GL features this week:

- Occlusion query support.
- GL_RASTERIZER_DISCARD support.
- Transform feedback's queries mostly supported.
- Fixed GL_OUT_OF_MEMORY (and OOMing the python runner!) on piglit's
  streaming-texture-leak.
- Fixed 8/16-bit integer texturing.

For VC4, the big news is that we've landed Boris's MADVISE support in
Mesa as well now.  This means that if you have a 4.15 kernel and the
next release of Mesa, the kernel will now be able to clean up the
userspace BO cache when we run out of CMA.  This doesn't prevent all
GL_OUT_OF_MEMORY errors, but it should reduce the circumstances where
you can hit them.

I spent a while putting together a backport of all our kernel
development for Raspbian's rpi-4.9.y branch.  So much has happened in
DRM in the last year, that it's getting harder and harder to backport
our work.  However, the PR I sent brings in fully functional support
for the DSI panel (no more purple flickering!) and fix for a
longstanding race that could crash the kernel when powering down the
GPU (thanks to Stefan Schake for debugging and providing a patch!)

I also fixed the VC4 build and armhf cross-builds with the new meson
build system, after Timothy Arceri noted that it wasn't working on his
Pi.  I'm now happily using meson for all of my Mesa development.
