summary:    VC4 display, V3D kernel and userspace

For VC4, I landed Stefan Schake's patches for CTM support (notably
Android color correction) and per-plane alpha (so you can fade planes
in and out without rewriting the alpha in all the pixels).  He also
submitted patches to the kernel and Mesa for syncobjects/fence fd
support (needed for Android HWC2, which I gave some simplifying
feedback for but are otherwise almost ready to land.

For V3D, I incorporated Daniel Vetter's feedback to the DRM code and
resubmitted it.  I'm optimistic for merging to 4.18.  I then spent a
while trawling the HW bug reports looking for reasons for my remaining
set of GPU hangs on 7278, generating a large set of Mesa patches (most
of which were assertions for those GPU restrictions I learned about,
and which we aren't triggering yet).  While I was doing that, I also
went through some CTS and piglit failures, and:

- fixed gallium's refcounting of separate stencil buffers
- fixed reloads of separate-stencil buffers
- added v4.x MSAA support
- added centroid varying support
- fixed a bit of 2101010 unorm/snorm texture support in gallium
- fixed a few EGL tests from the GLES CTS
